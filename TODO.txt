-- Command Line Parser --
1. Implement shortcuts for commands (e.g. look = l)

Commands to implement:
	examine
	take
	equip
	put
	drop
	search, forage, gather
	use (potion, apply enchantment, eat food)
	stats
	abilities
	interact
	pick (lock)

-- Major Mechanics --
1. Inventory system
2. Interactable items (chests, keys/doors, etc)
3. NPC Dialogue exchange
4. Combat


Tackling Next:
** Inventory System
	* Highlight items that can be examined or picked up in the 'look' text.
	* Create key and door that can't be opened without the key to exemplify interactable objects.
