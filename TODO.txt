** Combat!!
	* Player has list of abilities kept in YAML file.
		* Each ability has a level requirement and a flag for if it's unlocked or not.
	* Combat mode will allow the player to type in what ability they want to use (via the 'use' command).
	* 'abilities' command will list the abilities that the player has unlocked and what they do.
	* After an ability is triggered by player, roll is done, and enemy will (for the time being, randomly) choose an ability to attack with.
	* Each enemy will be defined in the YAML config with starting HP, MP, and ability list.
	* Each ability will be defined in YAML, with level requirement, damage, unlock flag.
	* Create Ability.py class to hold ability specifics.
